	Hello, world!

I’m Liam A Edwards, a Linux enthusiast and newly Site Reliability Engineer.

This blog will be a space for me to share insights on Linux, discuss principles of Site Reliability Engineering, provide tech tutorials, and offer my perspective on the tech industry. Whether you’re a seasoned tech professional or a curious beginner, I hope you’ll find something of interest here.

I look forward to taking this journey of exploration and learning with you.

More posts will slowly follow.

Cheers,

Liam A Edwards
